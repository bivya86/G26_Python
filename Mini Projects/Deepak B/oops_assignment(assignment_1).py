#Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming and is used extensively in the real world. 
#There are several types of inheritance, including single inheritance, multiple inheritance, multilevel inheritance, 
#hierarchical inheritance, and hybrid inheritance1. The complexity of these types of inheritance varies depending on the 
#specific use case and the relationships between the classes involved. For example, single inheritance, 
#where a subclass inherits from one superclass, is relatively simple. On the other hand, multiple inheritance, 
#where a subclass inherits from two or more superclasses, can be more complex due to potential conflicts between 
#inherited methods and attributes2. In general, itâ€™s important to carefully design class hierarchies to ensure that 
#inheritance is used effectively and efficiently.
